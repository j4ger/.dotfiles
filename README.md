## Usage

** make sure to install the SDKs & apps ** 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:j4ger/.dotfiles.git ~/
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
mkdir ~/.config
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/nvim/lv-settings.lua ~/.config/nvim/lv-settings.lua
# probably not needed since I haven't actually changed any thing in it 
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/nvim/config.lua ~/.config/nvim/config.lua
```

then open a new session or `source ~/.zshrc``
